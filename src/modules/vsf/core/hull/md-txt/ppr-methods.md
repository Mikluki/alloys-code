## short methods paragraph

For each structure on or near the convex hull selected from the Materials Project, we generated a volumetric equation-of-state dataset by isotropically scaling the equilibrium cell volume in 21 steps between 0.80 and 1.20 of the original volume. At each scaled volume, we relaxed only the internal atomic coordinates using VASP (PREC=ACCURATE, ENCUT=520 eV, spin-polarized PBE, LASPH=TRUE) with fixed cell shape and volume (NSW=99, IBRION=1, ISIF=2), and extracted the final total energy, stress tensor, and optimized atomic positions. The hydrostatic pressure was computed as (P = -$\tfrac{1}{3}\mathrm{Tr}(\sigma))$. We then evaluated a pre-trained graph neural network interatomic potential on the same relaxed structures, using identical cell parameters and atomic coordinates, to obtain GNN predictions of energy, stress, and pressure. This yields, for each structure and volume scaling factor, paired VASP–GNN data ((E(V), P(V))), from which we compare the shape of the equation-of-state, errors in (P(V)), and derived quantities such as the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus obtained by Birch–Murnaghan fits.
