### Formulas

**Mass-normalized $\text{H}_2\text{O}_2$ productivity:**

$$
\text{H}_2\text{O}_2\ \text{productivity} \left(\frac{\text{mmol}}{g _\text{metal} \cdot h}\right) =
\frac{\text{mmoles of formed H}_2\text{O}_2}{\text{weight of metal (g)} \times \text{reaction time (h)}}
$$

**Cost-normalized $\text{H}_2\text{O}_2$ productivity:**

$$
\text{H}_2\text{O}_2 \text{productivity}  \left(\frac{\text{mmol}}{\$\cdot h}\right) =
\frac{\text{mmoles of formed H}_2\text{O}_2}{\text{cost of metal (\$}_\text{metal}) \times \text{reaction time (h)}}
$$

**Reaction Formula:**

$$
\text{O}_2 + 2 \text{H}^+ + 2 e^- ;; \longrightarrow ;; \text{H}_2\text{O}_2
$$

Hydrogen peroxide productivity is evaluated by the amount of H₂O₂ formed per unit mass or cost of catalyst per hour.


### Delta E_form


$$
\Delta E_{\mathrm{form}} = \left| E_{\mathrm{form}}^{\mathrm{VASP}} - E_{\mathrm{form}}^{\mathrm{SevenNet}} \right|
$$


### Conclusions

- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are suitable for high-throughput screening of bimetallic catalysts. Among tested models, SevenNet performed best.
- GNNs cannot be considered universal interatomic potentials — they fail on random structures.
- A comprehensive benchmark dataset was developed to test GNN performance. A paper describing this dataset is in preparation.


### Future directions

- Finish submit and publish an article
- filtering current best 1445 candidates from bimetallic dataset using dos metric
- Synthesis of resulitng best candidates
- Experimental validation of the Catalytic activity on Hydrogen Evolution Reaction reaction
